# Clustering Youth Risk Behavior Data

This repository contains a comprehensive clustering analysis of youth survey responses using both the full dataset and domain-specific subsets (mental health, home environment, social relations, and physical activity). The goal is to identify meaningful participant clusters based on response patterns.

## Domain-Wise Clustering
We begin by clustering mental health indicators together with one contextual domain at a time:
- Home Environment + Mental Health
- Social Environment+ Mental Health
- Physical Activity + Mental Health

This approach allows for targeted exploration of how each context relates to mental health patterns.

## Full-Model Clustering 
We are currently developing a model that clusters across all domains simultaneously, including:
- Mental Health
- Home Environment
- Social Environment
- Physical Activity
- Other factors

## Comparison Goals
We aim to:
- Identify whether similar subgroups emerge across domains
- Evaluate if full-model clustering reveals additional nuance
- Determine which strategy yields clearer and more actionable subgroup distinctions
